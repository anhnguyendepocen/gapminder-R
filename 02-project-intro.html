<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and eventually everything is a bit mixed together.</p>

Managing your projects in a reproducible fashion doesn’t just make your science reproducible, it makes your life easier.

<p>Most people tend to organize their projects like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/bad_layout.png" />

</div>
<p>There are many reasons why we should <em>ALWAYS</em> avoid this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It is really hard to tell which version of your data is the original and which is the modified;</li>
<li>It gets really messy because it mixes files with various extensions together;</li>
<li>It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code that has been used to generate it;</li>
</ol>
<p>A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will help ensure the integrity of your data;</li>
<li>It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else (a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);</li>
<li>It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;</li>
<li>It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-possible-solution">A possible solution</h3>
<p>Fortunately, there are tools and packages which can help you manage your work effectively.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management functionality. We’ll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible project.</p>
<section class="challenge panel panel-success">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h4 id="challenge-creating-a-project"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span>Challenge – Creating a Project</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>We’re going to create a new project in RStudio:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click the “File” menu button, then “New Project”.</li>
<li>Click “New Directory”.</li>
<li>Click “Empty Project”.</li>
<li>Type a descriptive directory name: This is the title of yoru project, e.g. “DC_Workshop”.</li>
<li>Store the new directory in a sensable place in your computer’s organizational scheme.</li>
<li>Click “Create Project”.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</section>
<p>Now when we start R in this project directory, or open this project with RStudio, all of our work on this project will be entirely self-contained in this directory.</p>
<h3 id="best-practices-for-project-organisation">Best practices for project organisation</h3>
<p>Although there is no “best” way to lay out a project, there are some general principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:</p>
<h4 id="treat-raw-data-as-read-only">Treat raw data as read only</h4>
<p>This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection. It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as “read-only”.</p>
<h4 id="treat-generated-output-as-disposable">Treat generated output as disposable</h4>
<p>Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.</p>
<p>There are lots of different was to manage this output. I find it useful to have an output folder with different sub-directories for each separate analysis. This makes it easier later, as many of my analyses are exploratory and don’t end up being used in the final project, and some of the analyses get shared between projects.</p>
<h4 id="separate-function-definition-and-application">Separate function definition and application</h4>
<p>The most effective way I find to work in R, is to play around in the interactive session, then copy commands across to a script file when I’m sure they work and do what I want. You can also save all the commands you’ve entered using the <code>history</code> command, but I don’t find it useful because when I’m typing its 90% trial and error.</p>
<p>When your project is new and shiny, the script file usually contains many lines of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their own functions. It’s a good idea to separate these into separate folders; one to store useful functions that you’ll reuse across analyses and projects, and one to store the analysis scripts.</p>
<h4 id="a-possible-organization-scheme">A possible organization scheme</h4>
<ul>
<li>data</li>
<li>code</li>
<li>results</li>
<li>papers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="download-gapminder-data-to-the-data-directory">Download gapminder data to the data directory</h3>
<p>Now we will create a good directory structure and save the data file in the <code>data/</code> directory.</p>
<section class="challenge panel panel-success">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h4 id="challenge-project-organization"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span>Challenge – Project Organization</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In your project directory, either using the Project tab of RStudio or your OS’ file system, create the following directories:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>data</li>
<li>code</li>
<li>results</li>
<li>papers</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Files with the .RDA extension are R-Data files. Right-click on <a href="https://github.com/michaellevy/gapminder-R/raw/gh-pages/data/continents.RDA">this link</a> to “save file as …”</li>
<li>Save the <code>continents.RDA</code> file to the <code>data/</code> directory in your project</li>
</ol>
<p>We will load and inspect this dataset next.</p>
