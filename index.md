**Introduction to R for social scientists using the Gapminder dataset**

This is a two-day intensive introduction to modern computational techniques for data management, analysis, and visualization with an emphasis on the programming language R. The course assumes no prior programming knowledge. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to efficiently clean data, organize it for analysis, estimate and work with the output of statistical models, produce a variety of publication-quality plots, and compose dynamic documents that integrate writing, code, and code output.
